## Local Development

The project includes a Makefile with Docker-based commands that don't require local Hugo installation.

### Development Server

Start the development server with drafts enabled:

```bash
make serve
```

Visit `http://localhost:1313/` to browse the site with live reload.

Other serve options:

- `make serve-future` - Include future-dated posts
- `make serve-prod` - Production-like server (no drafts)
- `make serve-clean` - Server without drafts
- `PORT=8080 make serve` - Use custom port

### Building

Build the site for development:

```bash
make build
```

Build for production:

```bash
make build-prod
```

Static site output goes to `blog/public/`.

### Other Commands

- `make clean` - Remove build artifacts
- `make help` - Show all available commands
