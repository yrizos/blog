It wasn’t just about teaching her to balance and pedal. It was about helping her see what she could do once she started trusting herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started with a balance bike. My wife insisted on getting one. I was skeptical. Balance bikes didn’t exist when I was growing up. We learned on bikes with training wheels, leaning the wrong way, and developing bad habits that had to be unlearned later. The balance bike seemed too simple, almost like skipping a step.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
