I had been carrying the final chapter on my old Kindle for 2 weeks, finding reasons to delay. The story deserved better than a rushed ending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forest was quiet that morning except for the wind moving through pine branches and the occasional distant shout from where the children were learning below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every other Saturday, my daughter attends environmental consciousness classes at the Hymettus Forest. She learns through play, discovering how to care for nature, herself, and her group. What began as her educational experience has grown into a meaningful ritual for both of us.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
