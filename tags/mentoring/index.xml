&lt;p&gt;That single word captures everything after 3 days at the {Re}Solve Hackathon by Open at the Thessaloniki International Fair 2025. The kind that comes from being fully present, from watching builders turn ideas into working prototypes, and from seeing teams create things they had not thought possible. The tiredness felt earned, interesting, fun, and at times humbling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My alarm went off at 6 am on Friday. I arrived at the airport by 7:30 am, landed in Thessaloniki at 9:30 am, and entered the venue by 10:15 am. By Sunday night, I was back home in Athens. A whirlwind weekend of a thousand freddo espressos. And I was there only to observe and guide. I can’t even begin to imagine how the actual builders felt.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
