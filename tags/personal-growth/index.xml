It wasn’t just about teaching her to balance and pedal. It was about helping her see what she could do once she started trusting herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started with a balance bike. My wife insisted on getting one. I was skeptical. Balance bikes didn’t exist when I was growing up. We learned on bikes with training wheels, leaning the wrong way, and developing bad habits that had to be unlearned later. The balance bike seemed too simple, almost like skipping a step.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Where Do You Do Your Best Thinking?</title><link>https://yrizos.com/writing/where-do-you-do-your-best-thinking/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 12:09:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yrizos.com/writing/where-do-you-do-your-best-thinking/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I finished reading Gabrielle Zevin’s &lt;em&gt;Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow&lt;/em&gt; on a Saturday morning in October. I had been carrying the final chapter on my old Kindle for 2 weeks, finding reasons to delay. The story deserved better than a rushed ending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forest was quiet that morning except for the wind moving through pine branches and the occasional distant shout from where the children were learning below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every other Saturday, my daughter attends environmental consciousness classes at the Hymettus Forest. She learns through play, discovering how to care for nature, herself, and her group. What began as her educational experience has grown into a meaningful ritual for both of us.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
