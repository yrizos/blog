I’m Yannis Rizos, Chief Software Architect at [Epignosis](https://www.epignosishq.com/) in Athens, Greece. For almost 20 years, I’ve worked on the backend of learning platforms, reservation systems, marketplaces, and e-commerce products.

I lead the Architecture Team at [TalentLMS](https://www.talentlms.com/), keeping a large platform stable while helping other teams move faster. Most of my work now is about modernization without disruption and decisions that balance long-term integrity with short-term needs.

I started programming at 7 and soon came across Larry Wall's three virtues: **laziness**, **impatience**, and **hubris**. They still make sense. Build systems that can look after themselves. Anticipate failure early. Have the nerve to make the hard call when comfort is easier. The last part never stops being difficult.

I occasionally [write](/writing/) about what those decisions look like in practice. Technical trade-offs. The messy reality of team dynamics. The quiet work that keeps systems from breaking. If you only have time to read one thing, start with [my romantic take on AI coding](/writing/the-end-of-coding-as-we-know-it/).

If you want to get in touch, I’m on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yrizos/).
