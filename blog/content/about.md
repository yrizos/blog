I'm Yannis Rizos, Chief Software Architect at [Epignosis](https://www.epignosishq.com/) in Athens, Greece. I have spent nearly 20 years designing and building backend systems for learning platforms, reservation engines, marketplaces, and e-commerce products. Today I lead the Architecture Team at [TalentLMS](https://www.talentlms.com/), focusing on modernizing our platform and enabling other teams to move faster.

I discovered programming at 7 and soon after came across Larry Wall's three virtues: **laziness**, **impatience**, and **hubris**. The idea is to build systems that sustain themselves, prevent crises before they appear, and have the confidence to make hard decisions when comfort would be easier. That last one is the hardest.

I occasionally write about these decisions: the trade-offs that come with building systems meant to last, and the organizational forces that shape them.
