I’m Yannis Rizos, Chief Software Architect at [Epignosis](https://www.epignosishq.com/) in Athens, Greece. For almost 20 years, I’ve worked on the backend of learning platforms, reservation systems, marketplaces, and e-commerce products.

I started programming at 7 and soon came across Larry Wall’s three virtues: **laziness**, **impatience**, and **hubris**. They still make sense. Build systems that can look after themselves. Anticipate failure early. Have the nerve to make the hard call when comfort is easier. That part is always hard.

At [Epignosis](https://www.epignosishq.com/), I lead the Architecture Team at [TalentLMS](https://www.talentlms.com/), keeping a large platform stable while helping other teams move faster. Much of my work is about modernization without disruption and choices that balance long-term integrity with short-term needs.

I sometimes [write](/writing/) about what those choices look like in practice. Technical trade-offs. The messy reality of team dynamics. The quiet work that keeps systems from breaking. If you only have time to read one piece, you may start with [my romantic take on AI coding](/writing/the-end-of-coding-as-we-know-it/).

If you want to get in touch, I’m on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yrizos/).
